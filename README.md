# Mapping Hair Techniques across the African Disaspora
## Jaelyn Taylor, DIG 345, Spring 2021

### The Project Proposal:

This project was submitted on May 12, 2021 as the final project for DIG 345: Radical Software, taught by Dr. Owen Mundy. The scope of the project maps natural 
hairstyle techniques across the African diaspora, using my own independent research. This project was proposed with literally three weeks left in the semester, and 
so the final product as of May 12 is not a true reflection of half a semester's worth of effort towards this project. 

### The Challenges:

The decision to change my project so late in the semester was not made lightly. I had already made considerable progress on the other one, but the topic I had chosen
and data visualization methods I had envisioned were 1) slowly becoming infeasible and 2) were forcing me to engage with content (I chose) that was extremely
triggering in context of the socio-political turmoil around Black and other POC bodies and state violence occuring in tandem.

It was necessary, however, so thanks to Dr. Mundy for allowing me to do that change. Some other significant challenges with this project were trying to compensate for
loss time while wrapping up other classes and beginning new finals and dealing with the effects of the second dose of the COVID vaccine that took me out of commission
for a few days. 

That being said, I am just honestly truly happy that I have something to submit! I thought about asking for an extension, but in hindsight, knew that wouldn't be 
useful. As someone who just wanted to be done with the semester, an extension would just prolong it. I also admitedly considered just turning in a blank file and 
taking a large L, but thankfully talked myself out of that. I definitely recognize I could've put my pride to the side numerous times and reached out for help 
with some of the coding elements. I spent days just trying to get my leaflet to load before messaging Dr. Mundy and realizing I hadn't event downloaded the 
Leaflet library. 

### Future Plans:

I definitely want to revisit and keep improving upon this project. I haven't actually worked with HTML, CS, and JS in a *while* and this was such a good practice 
refresh those skills that were really good this time last year. In the final submission of the project, you can see some of the future plans already embeded, like
the menu options. I definitely want to do more with the map interactions themselves, and using the onClick function to prompt different events: an image loading, 
redirecting to another part of the page, etc. 

This was just me documenting the journey the last three weeks of this class has taken me on. While I wouldn't say I grew the most technically in this class, it 
was a very much needed lesson in advocating for myself, establishing boundaries, and coming to grips with how I learn best. During an already unconventional year,
this was an unexpected, but appreciated lesson. This README file is to help document that and remind myself when I visit this project again sometime this summer.
